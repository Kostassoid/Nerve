Nerve is a federated message bus for .NET. It allows for fast and easy concurrent message routing and processing without thread synchronization.

It's based on existing ideas, but does not force to adhere to any specific style of message processing.

To name a few:
* [Event Aggregator](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventAggregator.html)
* [Actor Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
* [Reactive Extensions](https://rx.codeplex.com/)
* [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/)

See [Quick start](https://github.com/Kostassoid/Nerve/wiki/Quick-start) page for more details.
